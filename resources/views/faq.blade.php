        <p class="question">We are not on the preferred supplier panel but believe we have a strong candidate for consideration?</p>
        <p>You must make contact with Human Resources to discuss. Only in exceptional circumstances will we go off panel to
            source candidates.</p>
        <p class="question">Can we refer candidates to all roles on the RMIT website?</p>
        <p>You will only be able to refer candidates to roles your agency has been invited to.

        <p class="question">We have several Consultants who work on the RMIT’s account. Can we have multiple login access?</p>
        <p>Each agency office has been set up as a user with a user name and password. All consultants from the agency must
        submit candidates using this user name and password. Individual usernames and passwords will not be set up for
        individual consultants. When a consultant leaves the agency it is the agency’s responsibility to change the
            password.</p>
        <p class="question">What if the candidate is submitted by more than one agency?</p>
        <p>Where a candidate is submitted by more than one agency for the same position, the first agency to register the
        candidate with us receives the placement fee. We will pay the agency the agreed placement fee for any candidate
        we hire which you have submitted through the e-recruitment system within 6 months of the candidate being
            registered. After 6 months, no placement fee is payable.</p>
        <p class="question">What if the candidate is submitted by an agency (or more than one agency) for consideration to different
            positions?</p>
        <p>Where a candidate has been submitted by more than one agency for consideration to various openings within RMIT,
        we will pay the agency the agreed placement fee for the role in which we will hire the candidate for, not to the
            agency that registered the candidate first.</p>
        <p class="question">What if the candidate is already on RMIT’s database but no contact has been made within 6 months of
            registration?</p>
        <p>If a candidate is already on RMIT’s database and no contact has been made within 6 months of initial
        registration or last contact, then the agency can submit the candidate’s details
            How does the e-recruitment system identify a candidate?
            The e-recruitment system identifies each candidate by the candidate’s email address.</p>
        <p class="question">Why do I need to supply the candidate’s personal email address?</p>
        <p>Apart from the candidate’s CV, the email address is the only personal information required of the candidate. The
            email is the identifier we use to ensure that candidates on the system are unique.</p>
        <p class="question">Will candidates be contacted directly?</p>
        <p>No, all correspondence (successful or otherwise) will be sent to the generic agency email address that has been
        set-up for use on the RMIT site. RMIT will only make direct contact after obtaining permission from the agency.</p>
        <p class="question">What if I want more information about the role?</p>
        <p>The online recruitment system intention isn’t to eliminate communication between the recruiter and Agent. If you
            require more information RMIT welcomes you to contact the recruiter for the vacancy.</p>
        <p class="question">What happens if a candidate wants to change the agency that represents them?</p>
        <p>If a candidates wishes to be represented by your agency but they have been represented by another agency in the
            last 6 months. RMIT will require written notice from the candidate requesting this change.</p>
